I have many large git repositories of Java code. I need to create a report of all dependencies and their corresponding version numbers in the Maven/Gradle files for each repository. To make the process more efficient, I need the script to clone the repositories locally.
The report file must be in CSV format with the data ordered in the following sequence: RepositoryName, ArtifactName, ArtifactVersion.
Name the report CSV file "dependency_report {date_time}.csv", replacing the {date_time} with the current date and time.
The solution must be contained entirely within the 1 Python program, except for the list of repositories, which should be in a file called repositories.txt. The repositories.txt file must contain real repository URLs.
Use the subprocess function to run the git clone process.
I choose the robust solution.
